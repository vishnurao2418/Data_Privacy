# Data_Privacy
Data Privacy (DSE, Semester V): This course introduces the principles, techniques, and legal frameworks of data privacy. It covers topics such as protection of personal and sensitive data, anonymization, data security practices, . Students learn how to balance data utility with privacy in real-world applications.

Privacy & Cryptography â€“ Short Info

ðŸ”¹ Anonymity (Hiding Identity & Traceability)

Pseudonyms â€“ Fake names/IDs to hide real identity.

Multiple Wallets â€“ Use of different wallets to reduce traceability.

Whistleblower Protection â€“ Safe way to reveal sensitive info anonymously.

Digital Signatures â€“ Ensure authenticity of digital data.

Group Signatures â€“ Any group member can sign without revealing who.

Ring Signatures â€“ Signer hidden within a group of possible signers.

Threshold Signatures â€“ Signature needs multiple participants.

PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) â€“ Tool for secure emails & file encryption.

Mixers/Tumblers â€“ Mix transactions to hide the source.

CoinJoin / CoinShuffle / CoinSwap â€“ Cryptocurrency privacy techniques.

Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) â€“ Prove knowledge without revealing the secret.

zk-SNARKs / zk-Rollups â€“ Blockchain privacy & scalability methods.

Monero â€“ Privacy coin using RingCT & stealth transactions.

Zcash â€“ Privacy coin using zk-SNARKs.

BOLT â€“ Privacy-preserving payment protocol.

ðŸ”¹ Confidentiality (Hiding Content & Amount)

Symmetric Encryption â€“ Same key for encryption & decryption.

Asymmetric Encryption â€“ Public-private key cryptography.

Homomorphic Encryption â€“ Compute on encrypted data.

Diffie-Hellman / ECDH â€“ Secure key exchange methods.

PAK â€“ Password-based secure key exchange.

PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) â€“ Framework using certificates.

X.509 Certificates â€“ Standard for digital certificates.

MAC / HMAC â€“ Check integrity of messages.

PRF (Pseudorandom Function) â€“ Generates secure random values.

KDF (Key Derivation Function) â€“ Derives keys from a master key.

OPE (Order Preserving Encryption) â€“ Keeps order in encrypted values.

MPC (Multi-Party Computation) â€“ Secure joint computation.

Key Lifecycle â€“ Generation, rotation, revocation of keys.

HSM (Hardware Security Module) â€“ Device for secure key storage.

Crypto Agility â€“ Ability to switch cryptographic methods easily.

NIST / Standards â€“ Guidelines for cryptography & security.

ðŸ”¹ Network-Layer Privacy

IPSec â€“ Secures IP packets.

VPN â€“ Encrypted tunnel for secure communication.

TOR â€“ Onion routing for anonymous browsing.

ðŸ”¹ Identity & Governance

Knowledge-based Credentials â€“ Passwords, PINs.

Possession-based Credentials â€“ Tokens, smartcards.

Inherence-based Credentials â€“ Biometrics (fingerprint, iris, face).

Centralized Identity â€“ Managed by one authority.

Decentralized Identity â€“ User controls identity.

Claims & Attributes â€“ Data like age, email, roles for identity proof.

DID (Distributed Identity) â€“ Self-sovereign distributed identity.

Digital ID Systems â€“ National/state IDs like Aadhaar (India).
